"Official" Snort.org RPM Documentation
======================================

Official Snort.org RPMs are back and better than ever.  However, we've
made some changes that you need to be aware of, and we've documented some
other things of interest.

Thanks to JP Vossen (http://www.jpsdomain.org/security/snort.html) who was
originally guilted into taking over RPM upkeep <g>, and to Daniel
Wittenberg (http://www.starken.com/) who graciously volunteered to help
and to provide a build host. The RPMs are now being co-maintained by them.
Send e-mail to rpms@snort.org with any comments or questions.


Improvements
------------
We've made a lot of changes under the covers to improve the flexibility
and maintainability of the RPMs going forward. See the next section for
details about that.

The most interesting and significant is the new ability to build RPMs
directly from the source code tarball! That means you can download either
a release tarball or one of the nightly CVS snapshot tarballs and build
RPMs *almost* effortlessly. See README.build_rpms [0] for the details and
the caveat about the "current" snapshot.


Changes from the previous Snort RPMs
------------------------------------

Use this command to view the most current change log before you install
the latest package:
	rpm -q --changelog -p snort-x.x.x-x.i386.rpm | less


Beginning with Snort 2.0.2, the official RPMs include the following
changes:

* snortd has been significantly revised to better conform with the
/etc/sysconfig scheme. See /etc/sysconfig/snort and /etc/init.d/snortd for
details.

* The doc, contrib and signatures directories are included in your doc
directory (e.g. /usr/share/doc/snort-x.x.x).

* The signatures directory is gzipped to save space beginning with Snort
2.1.0.

* The signatures directory is moved out from doc to the root of the Snort
documentation directory to make it more visible.

* Rules have been moved to /etc/snort/rules for readability and more 
compatibility with rule-updating software like oinkmaster.

* The RPM SPEC file has been significantly revised and documented. It has
also been added to the source tarball (contrib/rpm), facilitating building
your own RPM directly from the tarball. See README.build_rpms [0] and the
SPEC [2] file for details.

* The binary packages built by the SPEC file have been simplified, and
rpmbuild '--with' options have been added to facilitate easy
do-it-yourself builds. See README.build_rpms [0] and the SPEC [2] file for
details.

* Neither version of flexresp is included in the official binary RPMs. You
may build it in yourself if needed.

* We've added a lot of new documentation about RPMs, like this document
you're reading.


Supported Distributions
=======================
The rpmbuild -ta method and new SPEC file have been tested and are known
to work on Red Hat 7.3, 8.0, 9, and 2.9.5AS Beta (Taroon).  Some basic build
tests have been done on SuSE 8.1 and 8.2 (which use rpm version 3).

They should also work on any distribution that supports RPM and have rpm v4
or better. Please submit problems, comments and patches to rpms@snort.org.

Support for Fedora (fedora.redhat.com) naming convention RPMs is included.
cAos (www.caosity.org) RPMs are also supported so you should be able to
install and maintain Snort via yum and the cAos mirrors without any
additional effort.
