How to build your own Snort RPMs--Introduction
==============================================
RPM is the accepted package manager for a large number of Linux
distributions. It is designed to allow easy and repeatable builds and
binary installations for software. This is especially important for a
package like Snort, where security and consistency are critical. Since you
should never install a compiler on a hardened machine, and especially
never on a security device like a firewall or IDS, a binary installer like
RPM makes it very easy to install and update software.

However, many people are not comfortable unless they download and compile
the software themselves. This document will show you how to download the
Snort source code, compile it and build your own RPM very easily.

RPM requires a SPEC file to provide details on how to compile and build
the source code into an RPM package. The most difficult and time consuming
part of building an RPM is writing a correct SPEC file. We've already done
that for you (and it is heavily commented as well). The Snort.org SPEC
file can build the following packages, with or without flexible response
(see README.flexresp for more details):

	Snort Plain (required for all others)
	Snort with MySQL
	Snort with PostgreSQL
	Snort with Oracle (EXPERIMENTAL)


Prerequisites
=============
In order to build RPMs you must install the 'rpm-build' package. You will
also need the following if you plan to build packages other than plain:

	Package				Dependency
	---------------------		----------------
	All				rpm-build (rpm version 4 and above),
						pcre-devel
	Snort with MySQL		MYSQL-devel, pcre-devel
	Snort with PostgreSQL		postgresql-devel, pcre-devel
	Snort with Oracle		Oracle libs in /opt/oracle, pcre-devel

If you plan to build flexresp, you also need libnet. Depending on which
libnet RPM you install, you may get statically linked binaries. If you
have statically linked libraries you only need the static library on the
build machine, NOT the machine on which the final compiled binary runs.
Given the fact that Snort sensors are security devices and having dynamic
libnet capabilities may be undesirable, static linking is a Good Thing.

The strongly recommended libnet to use is custom 1.0.2a Packetfactory RPM
Chris Green built a while ago that may be found here [0]. This is the only
Snort.org supported libnet and it allows snort to statically compile
libnet as noted above.


Building from a Tarball
=======================
If you have a recent version of RPM which supports the -tx options, you
can build directly from the official Snort.org tarball distribution. RPM
versions 4 and above are known to work.  Some versions of rpm 3 have been 
known to work, specifically those with SuSE 8.1 and SuSE 8.2

Version 4:
rpmbuild {package options} -ta {path/to/snort-n.n.n.tar.gz}

Version 3:
rpm {package options} -ta {path/to/snort-n.n.n.tar.gz}

(We will assume version 4 elsewhere in the documentation)


rpmbuild Package Options
========================

	--with flexresp
		Add flexresp capability to whatever package(s) you are
		building.

	--with mysql
		Builds a binary/package with support for MySQL.

	--with postgresql
		Builds a binary/package with support for PostgreSQL.

	--with oracle
		Builds a binary/package with support for Oracle.

 	--with fedora
		Builds the same binary packages as above, but will name
		the resulting binary RPM's suitable for use with Fedora.

See below for some examples.


Rebuilding from the Source RPM (SRPM)
=====================================
You can also download the source RPM and rebuild from that. Simply get the
SRPM from Snort.org and rebuild:

	rpmbuild --rebuild /path/to/snort-x.x.x-x.src.rpm


rpmbuild examples
=================

$ rpmbuild --with mysql --with postgresql -ta snort-2.0.4.tar.gz

--OR--

$ rpmbuild --with mysql --with postgresql --rebuild snort-2.0.4-1.src.rpm

<snip>

$ ls -1 /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/snort-*
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/snort-2.0.4-1.i386.rpm
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/snort-mysql-2.0.4-1.i386.rpm
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/snort-postgresql-2.0.4-1.i386.rpm


The "Official" Snort.org RPM build
==================================
We build the official Snort.org RPMs with the generate-all-rpms script in
the contribs/rpm directory.

In theory, anyone can build RPMs that are identical to the official
Snort.org RPMS.  However, only the official RPMs will be signed by the
Snort.org GPG key [1].

PLEASE verify your RPMs with this key before installing them.


Distribution Specific Builds
============================
The SPEC file contains code to build RPMS for specific Linux
distributions, currently Fedora (fedora.redhat.com) and cAos
(www.caosity.org). In the case of Fedora you will use '--with fedora' on
the rpmbuild command line to build with Fedora's naming scheme. Since the
cAos buildsystem is completely automated, no rpmbuild command line options
are allowed, so the SPEC file looks for the '/usr/lib/rpm/caos' directory
to see if it's running under cAos. This is not ideal as it will build all
packages under any cAos machine--not just the autobuilder. But it's the
best I can do right now. Anyone have any better ideas?


Verifying an RPM's PGP/GPG Key
==============================
Download and add the Snort key to RPM:
	wget http://www.snort.org/public-key.html
	rpm --import public-key.html

Verify the signature:
	rpm --checksig /path/to/snort-x.x.x-x.i386.rpm
	rpm -v --checksig /path/to/snort-x.x.x-x.i386.rpm
	-- OR --
	rpm -K /path/to/snort-x.x.x-x.i386.rpm
	rpm -vK /path/to/snort-x.x.x-x.i386.rpm

If you see something like the following, it's good. NOTE, you MUST see
"gpg OK" for the signature to exist and be valid! Any random RPM may be
created without a signature, so make sure your official RPM has one.
	/path/to/snort-x.x.x-xsnort.i386.rpm: (sha1) dsa sha1 md5 gpg OK

The -v (for verbose) options give you a little more detail.  Again, make
sure the signature lines present and OK.

If you see a "NOT OK" message, something did not verify.  Any items that
were correct will be listed in lower case (e.g. sha1 md5) while any failed
items are in upper case (e.g. GPG). There may also be an error message,
such as "MISSING KEYS."


Examining the SPEC file
=======================
We have tried to make the Snort.org SPEC file as "user friendly" as
possible. In particular, it has lots of comments.  So it may be useful to
look it over, or you may just want to build the old fashioned way. In any
case, there are three easy ways to get it.

Get it from Snort's CVS:
	http://cvs.snort.org/viewcvs.cgi/snort/contrib/rpm/snort.org.spec

Get it from the tarball:
	tar -xvzf /path/to/snort-x.x.x.tar.gz

Get it from the SRPM
	Get the SRPM from Snort.org
	Extract the SRPM: rpm2cpio /path/to/snort-x.x.x-x.src.rpm | cpio -i
	-- OR --
	Install the SRPM: rpm -i /path/to/snort-x.x.x-x.src.rpm


Building from Snort.org CVS Snapshots [2]
=========================================

Building from the "stable" snapshot should work as above. However,
building from the "current" snapshot requires some manual intervention.

1. Cd to /tmp or someplace safe: cd /tmp
2. Untar the source: tar -xvzf /path/to/snort-current.tar.gz
3. Rename the resulting snort directory: mv snort snort-current
4. Edit snort-current/contrib/rpm/snort.org.spec and change the line
	%define release {whatever}
to
	%define release 1
and
	Version: stable (or 2.1.x or whatever)
to
	Version: current
5. Rename the original tarball: mv snort-current.tar.gz snort-current-orig.tar.gz
6. Re-tar the file: tar -cvzf snort-current.tar.gz snort-current
7. Build as usual: rpmbuild -ta snort-current.tar.gz

If you don't know how to do all of that, you probably want the regular
compiled binary packages or the snort-stable snapshot.
