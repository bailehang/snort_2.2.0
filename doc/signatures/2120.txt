2120

--
Summary:
This event is generated when a remote user uses the IMAP CREATE command to send a suspiciously long string to port 143 on an internal server. This may indicate an attempt to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the IMAP CREATE command in the Alt-N MDaemon IMAP server.

--
Impact:
Remote execution of arbitrary code, which could allow an attacker to interfere with or crash mail services. The attacker must have a valid IMAP account and must be authenticated by the mail server to attempt this exploit.

--
Detailed Information:
This event may indicate an attempt to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Alt-N MDaemon IMAP server CREATE command. If an authenticated user creates a folder with a sufficiently long name on the Alt-N MDaemon IMAP server, arbitrary commands can be executed with system privileges. 

--
Affected Systems:
Any operating system that runs Alt-N MDaemon 6.7.5 or Alt-N MDaemon 6.7.9 IMAP servers.

--
Attack Scenarios:
An authenticated user can create a new folder with a sufficiently long name, creating a buffer overflow condition. The attacker can then execute arbitrary code with system privileges, which may allow the attacker to interfere with or crash mail services.

--
Ease of Attack:
Exploits exist, but the user must have an account and be authenticated before attempting the exploit.

--
False Positives:
None known.

--
False Negatives:
None known.

--
Corrective Action:
Upgrade to Alt-N MDaemon 6.7.10 or later.
