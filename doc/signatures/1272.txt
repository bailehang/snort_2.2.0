Rule:  

--

Sid:
1272

--

Summary:
Someone probed for the sadmind RPC service, possibly to gather information before an attack.

--
Impact:
If the target host runs Solaris with a vulnerable installation of sadmind, then this probe may have been a precursor to a remote root compromise.

--
Detailed Information:
The sadmind RPC service runs by default in Solaris from inetd, and is vulnerable to a remote root exploit through buffer overflow in Solaris 2.5 through 7.0.

--
Affected Systems:
 
--
Attack Scenarios:
An attacker runs an automated tool that connects to portmapper of the target host, probes for RPC, and repeatedly attacks the host to brute force the offset in the buffer overflow.

--
Ease of Attack:
Tools to probe and attack sadmind are widely available and quite reliable.

--
False Positives:
None Known
sadmind has legitimate use in remote system administration through tools like Solstice AdminSuite.

--
False Negatives:
None Known
It is difficult to say from the given information, but it may not be necessary in some circumstances
for an attacker to connect to the portmapper service before attacking the sadmind service.  A savvy attacker may use a port scanner or some other method to guess at the port of the sadmind service without consulting portmapper.

--
Corrective Action:
If the source was not a known Solaris sysadmin running Solstice AdminSuite, then this probe should be considered highly suspicious and a likely precursor to attack. Try to determine whether the target system was running a vulnerable installation of sadmind or not.  One of the popular exploits for this service opens a root shell listening on TCP port 1524.  Because of the way this popular exploit is programmed, it makes repeated probes to portmapper for
the sadmind service, and from each of those an attempt at the sadmind service itself, which is a very good indicator for this activity being an attack.
