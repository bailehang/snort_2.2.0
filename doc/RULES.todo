- sid:1913,1914,1915,1916 
  the content match detection stuff needs revisiting because we
  can't add the checks for format string checks within the mon_name buffer.
  The rule SHOULD look like the following if everything was working properly:

  mon_name format string exploit attempt"; content:"|00 01 86 B8|";       \
